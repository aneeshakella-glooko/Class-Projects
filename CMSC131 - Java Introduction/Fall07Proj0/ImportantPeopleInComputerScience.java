/* This is a very simple Java program that will print some stuff about
 * "Important People" in computer science.  Try running the program to see 
 * it working.  
 * 
 * Obviously, the facts stated in the output not correct!  FIX THEM by editing
 * the source-code below, and then submit the project. 
 * 
 * Please don't change the message of each item in the output, just 
 * change the incorrect VALUES mentioned in items 1, 2, 3, and 6; and change 
 * just the NAMES for items 4 and 5.  (For item #6, you should put in YOUR
 * section of CMSC 131.)
 * 
 * Please don't add or remove any lines from the output -- otherwise you will 
 * confuse the automated testing setup and you are likely not to pass the tests!
 * (This is not the time to be creative!)
 * 
 * NOTE:  If your name really is "Yngwie Malmsteen", then you should NOT modify
 *        item #4 in the list.  You should instead come to my office so I can
 *        get your autograph.  */
