I took code ideas/fragments from http://www.ugrad.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/2004oose/group1/iteration3/iter3/src/
Specifically i used their idea of having a class for key/guide nodes and also combined their insert with what i read from Samet.
I adapted their find function to also serve as my delete function.

Notes:
By the end of the project I have a good understanding of how the pr quadtree works and how everything ties together. However, i had a hard
time starting the project itself which is why by my reasoning I did not finish in time. A lot of the functionality is complete and just needs 
polishing or correct outputting. I will be starting much earlier and finishing much earlier on part 2.
